EECS 731 Project

This project is analyzing publicly-available data from the FBI's crime database and from a Kaggle dataset of firearm provisions across the nation. 

The Kaggle dataset (referred to as Gun Law Data) was processed to only include the data from 2015, 2016, and the change between those years. 
Both datasets were transformed to take the violent crime per capita data from the FBI dataset, the total gun laws by region data from the Kaggle dataset, and were combined to show the trends of gun law and violent crime per capita by each state, and they tend to show that there is no correlation between the number of gun laws in a state and the amount of violent crime per capita.
